# ElevateLabs_task3
This project implements a linear regression model to predict house prices based on features such as square footage, the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. The dataset used is the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) dataset from Kaggle.
The workflow includes:

* ðŸ“Š Data preprocessing: handling missing values and encoding categorical variables

* ðŸ“ˆ Model training: fitting a linear regression model using scikit-learn

* ðŸ§ª Evaluation: calculating performance metrics such as RÂ² and RMSE

* ðŸ“‰ Visualization: plotting predictions vs actual prices for model interpretation

* This project demonstrates practical application of machine learning in the real estate domain.
